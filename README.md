# Biyei Utils

A necessary resource for the functionality of my scripts, allowing you to freely and openly modify features that connect my shop's escrow scripts to this one.

This resource is always being constantly updated and is used in several of my scripts. It handles various elements such as bookmarks, key combinations, 3D text, callbacks and more.



## Installation

Always start before any Biyei script.

server.cfg
```cfg
  ensure biyei_utils
  ensure biyei_...
```
